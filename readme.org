* Interactive Commands
** helm-org-olp-find (file-name &optional olp)

final selection.

Called interactively or with nil FILE-NAME, navigate the current file starting
from OLP or current entry if nil.

C-u prefix will start with a file selection from org-agenda-files. Selecting a
non-existent file will create and select it from org-directory.

** helm-org-olp-refile-this

Interactively refile the current entry somewhere in the same buffer.

With C-u prefix, refile to another file in org-agenda-files. Selecting a
non-existent file will create and select it from org-directory.

** helm-org-olp-pick (file-name &optional olp)

Interactively select headings from FILE-NAME (or current buffer if nil),
starting at OLP (or top-level if nil), to form a new olp path.

Visit the heading in FILE-NAME denoted by OLP

** org-olp-refile (src-file-name olp-src dst-file-name olp-dst)
