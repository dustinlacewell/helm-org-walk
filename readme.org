* org-olp

This module provides some helpful elisp functions for working with org "olp" paths.

** =org-olp-visit= (file-name olp)
Visit the heading in FILE-NAME denoted by OLP
** =org-olp-select= (file-name olp)
Select and return olp of child of heading pointed to by OLP in FILE-NAME
** =org-olp-select-then-visit= (file-name olp)
Run org-olp-select then visit the resulting olp in FILE-NAME
** =org-olp-recursive-select= (file-name &rest olp)
Select headings from FILE-NAME, from OLP or top-level, until a heading with no
children is reached. The resulting olp is returned.
** =org-olp-find= (file-name &rest olp)
Run org-olp-recursive-select on FILE-NAME, starting from OLP or
top-level, then visit the selected heading.
** =org-olp-refile= (file-name olp-src olp-dst)
This function takes a filename and two olp paths it uses the
org-element api to remove the heading specified by the first olp and
then inserts the element *under* the heading pointed to by the second olp
